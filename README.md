_Example_

To access the `applyEncryption` attribute from `Envionment` class to Response Handler, write `environment.applyEncryption`;

## Notes

### 1. Why is my git pre-commit hook not executable by default?

- Because files are not executable by default; they must be set to be executable.

```
chmod ug+x .husky/*
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```
